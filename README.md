# AVERIL - Expression based CSS Framework

Averil is small compilation of styled UI elements into a minimal framework to help you build responsive apps and websites.
It uses expressions classes to allow for easier use, so you only need to remember what you want to apply and put a prefix.

Expressive prefixes used are as follwing:

```
	.is-* 	// used to assign state or apply modifier
	.has-*  // used for child elements to components
	.can-* 	// defines control classes to determine what elements 'can' do
	.do-* 	// control modifier to handle actions
```

## Installation

	1. clone this repo or download the latest release
	2. link the averil.scss to your main stylesheet using ```@import```
	3. You are good to go
